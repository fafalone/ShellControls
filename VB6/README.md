** DEPRECATED / OUT OF DATE **

This directory contains VB6 versions of ucShellBrowse and ucShellTree, but they are now several releases out of date as this project is now exclusively developed in twinBASIC, the backwards compatible successor to the classic VB language.

If you're unable to develop in tB right now, note that newer ShellControls versions still offer ActiveX Control versions (OCXs). It's recommended you use these twinBASIC-compiled binary versions in VB6; they have been tested to work there and it is supported (along with VBA 32bit and 64bit) so you're also welcome to report any bugs using the OCX.
