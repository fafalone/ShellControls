'For questions, comments, and bug reports, stop by the project thread:
'http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?862137-ucShellTree-Full-featured-Shell-Tree-UserControl
'
'----------------------------------------ABOUT-------------------------------------------
'This UserControl displays a TreeView of the Windows Shell, similar to the one
'found in Explorer. While there are other controls that are similar, and there's
'also the INamespaceTreeControl that actually hosts an Explorer TreeView, this has
'the advantage that it has modern styling and features that weren't available before
'Windows Vista, but being completely done in VB provides customizations that are
'not possible with the hosted object.
'
'-------------------------------------REQUIREMENTS---------------------------------------
'-Windows Vista or newer
'-oleexp.tlb v4.42 or higher
'
'STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Common Controls 6.0 manifest. Partial and exclusion checkboxes will
'                      not work, visual styling is effected, and other features may not work
'                      as well.
'-------------------------------------KEY FEATURES---------------------------------------
'-Displays complete Explorer-type tree with either Desktop or Computer as the root folder.
'-Tri-state checkboxes show partial selections when check mode is enabled
'-Supports drag/drop with modern drag images and drag-over-highlighting (including
'  expanding on hover), based on my cDropTarget project. Can drop on all valid drop targets:
'  folders, zip files, programs, shortcuts to them, etc.
'-Right-click shows the standard Explorer context menu for the clicked item
'-Automatically monitors for changes (item created, deleted, renamed) and updates the
'  tree accordingly.
'-Option to show files as well
'-Can automatically expand to a given path. NOTE: OpenToPath/OpenToItem can only be used
'  after loading; to open to a path on your Form_Load or Main() routine, use .InitialPath
'-InfoTips with several lines of details depending on file type are shown as ToolTips
'-Filter option can limit the type of files displayed (or even folders)
'-Can rename in place using LabelEdit
'-Can (optionally) treat .zip/.cab files as a folder
'-Optional additional root entry for 'Favorites' that shows the Links folder.
'-Browses the Network folder too and returns paths as \\Share\etcetc
'-Complete Unicode support
'
'
'---------------------------------------CHANGELOG----------------------------------------
'
'v2.7 (Released 25 Jan 2022)
'
'-Added ShowHiddenItems/ShowSuperHidden options
'
'-Added EnableShellMenu option to control whether the right-click menu pops up.
'
'-Added SetFocusOnTree method.
'
'-Added public event for UserControl_EnterFocus and UserControl_ExitFocus (EnterFocus
' and ExitFocus, respectively).
'
'-(Bug fix) Keyboard focus never went to ucTreeView when on a form with ucShellBrowse.
'
'v2.6 (Released 03 Apr 2021)
'
'-Eliminated the need to use a variable to keep tracking of dir change operations when
' combining this control with a ucShellBrowse control; previously you'd handle a path
' change notification from the browser with
' If bChanging = False Then
'    bChanging = True
'    ucShellTree1.OpenToItem siItem, False
'    bChanging = False
' End If
' Now you no long need the bChanging variable.
'
'-Added SelectNone sub, which will clear all selected items (supports multiselect).
'
'-Added ItemSelectByShellItem event. I wanted to just include an IShellItem member in
' ItemSelect, but the backwards compatibility concerns are too great. This event will
' also include all the information of ItemSelect if you want to fully switch over.
'-Did the same for ItemClick->ItemClickByShellItem
'
'-For MultiSelect, added the MultiSelectChange event, which includes an IShellItemArray
' of selected items as well as a name list and full path list
'
'-(Bug fix) Using On Error Resume Next to handle an uninitialized array in the Terminate
'           event caused the control to freeze on compile or on run after changes if
'           you were using it as an OCX.
'
'
'v2.5 R2 (Released 15 Dec 2020)
'
'-(Bug fix) Navigation in unmapped Network locations wouldn't expand properly. This may
'           also have effected other items, as the bug involves scenarios where two
'           IShellItem.GetDisplayName calls for the same location return a different case
'           at a different time, which resulted in an infinite loop looking for something
'           that should have been there, because case differed unexpectedly.
'
'v2.5 (Released 09 Dec 2020)
'
'-Added BackColor and ForeColor (text) options.
'
'-Added some missing style options: AutoHScroll, NoIndentState, TrackSelect, and
' ShowSelAlways. The latter two are enabled by default.
'
'-Added RefreshTreeView function. There already is 'ResetTreeView', but that restores the
' tree to its state on load. RefreshTreeView resets it then expands all the folders that
' were previously expanded, which will make any updates in the folders that were visible
' as they're loaded from scratch.
'
'-To perform the refresh, a list is generated of not all folders, but just one per end
' node, otherwise there'd be potentially hundreds of useless OpenToPath calls.
' This list is available if you want to view or save it through the new GetExpansionState
' function. If you want to load a saved list, also added LoadExpansionState. You can pass
' any list of full paths in a string delimited by a | if desired.
'
'-(Bug fix) If a portable device (e.g. phone, camera) was connected while the control was
'           running, it wouldn't be added to the tree.
'
'v2.4 (Released 20 Sep 2020)
'
'-Extended Verbs for the Shell Context Menu is now an option. If it's set to False (the
' default), you will need to hold down Shift when bringing up the menu to show the
' additional items, the same way it works in Explorer.
'
'-(Bug fix) Eliminated all non-explicit types that were defined in the type library, so
'           that no further conflicts with Public versions are possible.
'
'v2.3 (Released 19 August 2020)
'
'-(Bug fix) Extended styles were being cleared improperly. Checkboxes, ExclusionChecks,
'           FadingExpandos, and MultiSelect would not turn off once enabled.
'
'v2.2 (Released 23 April 2020)
'
'-Added DropFiles event and DragStart event.
'
'-Added Multiselect option. MSDN says "Not supported, do not use." but this style appears
' to be working without issue. Be advised, this deprecated status means that it could cease
' to work in future versions of Windows without notice.
' This effects dragging items, and a new Public Sub SelectedItems has been added; these are
' the only places multiselect currently effects.
'
'-Added DisableDragDrop option if you want to disable it.
'
'
'v2.17 (Released 15 Mar 2020)
'
'-(Bug fix) The default overlays that should always stay on weren't showing (Link/Share)
'
'v2.16 (Released 05 Mar 2020)
'
'-Made extended overlays, found in programs such as TortoiseSVN and Dropbox, a default-off
' option due to the extreme performance cost (a factor of 10-100).
'
'v2.15 (Released 19 Feb 2020)
'
'-(Bug fix) If a Private Enum defined in a UserControl had the same name as one that
'           is defined in a module containing Sub Main, placing more than one of the
'           UserControl in a project caused the control to be grayed out and then an
'           app crash when any other control was initially added to the form.
'           To fix this, all API enums in this control have been prefixed with ucsb_
'           If you're modifying the code of this control, just keep that in mind.
'           No change is needed for using this control or any other code as they're
'           all Private.
'
'-(Bug fix) In ensuring a USB device is already added after OpenToItem, the GetNodeByPath
'           function did not handle USB paths properly, so additional USB device entries
'           were added to the tree.
'
'v2.14
'
'-(Bug fix) If a USB media device (phone, camera, etc-- no drive letter) was added after
'           the program started, it could not be added to the TreeView-- there was some
'           issue with an infinite loop where it kept finding the parent but not adding
'           the child. I couldn't figure out where it was going wrong, so implemented a
'           workaround where the control checks whether it's being asked to navigate to
'           one of these devices, and if it is, manually ensures the device is added.
'           After that, subfolder adding works fine, you can directly navigate to a deep
'           path and all the subfolders will be added; the issue was just adding the
'           device itself.
'
'-(Bug fix) The control uses the SHChangeNotifyRegister API without its own declare; there
'           is a declare in the typelib, and since it wasn't declared explicitly, any
'           Public version in a project module would take precedence, which sometimes
'           caused Type Mismatch errors if the declare was slightly different.
'
'v2.13
'
'-InfoTips are now cached on first load.
'
'-Now store fully qualified pidls for each item, which enables compatibility with the search
' folders generated by ucShellBrowse's new search method (ISearchFolderItemFactory), as these
' for some reason lack a relative pidl even though other direct children of the desktop do not.
' There may be other types of objects lacking a relative pidl as well; this can only increase
' the number of item types supported.
'
'-(Bug fix) In Design Mode, the control displayed "Shell Tree Control 1.0" instead of the current
'           version number. It now gets the info from mVersionStr on Line #2 of this module.
'
'v2.12 (Released 16 June 2019)
'-(Bug fix) On Windows 10, when browsing some virtual devices, like connected phones or cameras,
'           the SHCreateItemFromParsingName fails when 2 levels or deeper. Changed navigation,
'           selection generation, and other features to have full pidl records to fall back on.
'
'v2.11 (Released 15 Feb 2019 - Critical bug fix only)
'-(Bug fix) Previous fix regarding PathMatchSpecW resulted in always loading the Computer
'           folder as root.
'
'v2.1 (Released 30 Jan 2019)
'-The font for the TreeView is now a standard property. (Borrowed from Krool's
' TreeView. Thanks!)
'
'-Shell context menu tips are now passed in the StatusMessage event.
'
'-Filter now supports multiple patterns separated by semi-colon.
'
'-Replaced Border property with BorderStyle, which has several more options.
'
'-(Bug fix) If the control was on a secondary form, unloading that form did not unload
'           the control, and it stayed loaded in the background until the whole program
'           ended. Thanks to dz32 and Eduardo- for figuring out the solution.
'
'-(Bug fix) Fixed automatic navigation not expanding when a parent of a parent was
'           collapsed; only the immediate parent was checked previously.
'
'-(Bug fix) Custom Roots were checked for validity with PathMatchSpecW, which does
'           not support virtual locations. Now it's checked by going ahead and trying
'           to create the IShellItem for it, allowing roots like ::{GUID}
'v2
'
'-You can now specify a custom folder as root*. Changeable during runtime.

'-Added PathGetCheck and PathSetCheck functions. The Set function also has an option to
' expand to show the given path in the event it's not yet visible.
'
'-The OpenToPath/OpenToItem functions now have an option to just expand to but not select
' the item, primarily for the check set function but available in general; default=select.
'
'-The .InitialPath property is deprecated. The creation sequence has changed, you can
' now just use OpenPath in your Form_Load (or equiv.) event. It remains for compatibility.
'
'-Added RootHasCheckbox option to set whether or not one appears (when checkboxes are enabled).
'
'-Added ExclusionChecks option, which adds an additional checkbox state- a red x. The .ExcludedPaths
' method functions in the same way as the .CheckedPaths method to retrieve paths in this state (they
' are not counted as checked).
'
'-Added ExplorerStyle option to allow control over whether the Explorer visual style is applied.
'
'-Added HorizontalScroll option, to set whether the tree expands without needed HScroll.
'
'-Adjusted the RootHasCheckbox option so that if it's changed at runtime, the correct state is set.
'
'-Changed disable criteria such that valid file drop targets are excepted from normal disabled prop
' list. This was mainly to get the Recycle Bin enabled since it's completely browsable. Other items
' remain disabled. (You can change this in TVExpandFolder if desired).
'
'-Added Autocheck option for control over whether partial checks are shown and whether parent and
' child items are automatically changed according to a new check action.
'
'-The control will now fall back to plain checkboxes if no Common Control 6 manifest is present, but
' all autocheck functionality is unavailable (even checking all children of a checked parent).
' Previously checkboxes were not present at all without a manifest.
'
'(Bug fix) The outer edge of the control on dragover indicated a droptarget on no item but
'          seemingly valid; it now correctly shows no drop is possible.
'
'(Bug fix) Invalid (malformed/corrupt) shortcut files caused an error that wasn't handled, so
'          the item enumeration when expanding a folder stopped when it reached it.
'
'(Bug fix) When you call GetParent on your user folder, you get the desktop instead of \Users\,
'          this caused some issues with auto-navigating.
'
'(Control/code) So I thought you needed to supply your own check imagelist for partial checkboxes,
'               since the extended style wasn't working, but it turned out the problem was just that
'               you can't set the TVS_CHECKBOXES style; just TVS_EX_PARTIALCHECKBOXES. So the images
'               have been removed, which eliminates transparency issues and will keep the appearance
'               the same as the OS.

' mIOLEInPlaceActiveObject Implementation
' Author:      Mike Gainer, Matt Curland and Bill Storage

' Requires:    OleGuids.tlb (in IDE only)
'
' Description:
' Allows you to replace the standard IOLEInPlaceActiveObject interface for a
' UserControl with a customisable one.  This allows you to take control
' of focus in VB controls.
'
' The code could be adapted to replace other UserControl OLE interfaces.

    '** v2.0 Re-write by LaVolpe, based mostly on Paul Caton's original thunks....... 20070720
    '** .... Reorganized & provided following additional logic
    '** ....... Unsubclassing only occurs after thunk is no longer recursed
    '** ....... Flag used to bypass callbacks until unsubclassing can occur
    '** ....... Timer used as delay mechanism to free thunk memory afer unsubclassing occurs
    '** .............. Prevents crash when one window subclassed multiple times
    '** .............. More END safe, even if END occurs within the subclass procedure
    '** ....... Added ability to destroy API windows when IDE terminates
    '** ....... Added auto-unsubclass when WM_NCDESTROY received
